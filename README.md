# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name Yolanda!

I am making a career pivot from an occupational therapy assistant to a full stack web developer. I'm excited to start on this journey and I hope you will join me on my adventure as I learn how to code! ðŸ˜„


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating my profile webpage and making it more accessible and trying my hand at contributing to some open-source.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and in the near future will be learning React, Node, Express, MongoDB, and Postgres. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects and learn how to do pair programing to improve my skills as a new developer. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with how to code using best practices and accessibility. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: message me on twitter!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun facts: I speak two languages, English and Japanese. I enjoy playing video games like animal crossing and RPGs.  I have lived, studied and worked abroad in Japan collectively for about 3 years.
